# Project: designed by mentors at Twitter

The Data Science Workshop is a three-week program where small teams of graduate students and postdocs are paired with mentors
from industry to analyze an outstanding problem in data science. 

This workshop has been a huge success. Workshop participants have gone on to work for companies such as Google, Twitter, Uber, Bayes Impact, Cisco Meraki, Rhumbix, Sojern, Kanjoya, 6sense, Bolt Threads, and ATP Endeavors! Many of our former participants have become Insight Data Science Fellows.

The project that I have been working on is , co-worked with Belen Guerra and Kan Shu, mentored by Twitter Data Scientists Anthony Fu and Todd Doughty.
